Raid of Temples is an Action/Adventure/Exploration based game in development by Gameplex Software. The game is set in a fantastical land of magic, wizards, fierce beasts and evil spirits. As your character progresses through the game, you level up your characterâ€™s skills and begin to be able to use, and create more advanced weaponry, and spells. There are a growing number of locations to explore and gather loot from, and more world to conquer. Raid of Temples is a free game for development versions, but your activities in these are limited. https://gameplex-software.github.io/rot
